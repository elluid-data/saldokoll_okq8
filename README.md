# saldokoll_okq8
Android app for logging in and retrieving transactions and checking the balance on your OKQ8 VISA card.  
Support for nightmode.
Authorization with Mobile BankID.
  
 `createCard(jsonAsText: String)` function in `OKQ8Card.kt` retrieves and loops through all the products available for the user.  
 Only builds the product VISA as that what is available for me, ideas is welcome!
